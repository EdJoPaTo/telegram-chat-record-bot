  Hey {$firstname}!
  Add me to a chat. I will start to record all the messages I can see as soon as I joined the group.

  If you like this bot send a thank you to {$username} or head to the GitHub Repository.

  Adding a random bot as an admin to your channel is maybe not the best ideaâ€¦

  Sincerely, a random bot, added as an admin to this channel.
group-joined =
  I'll immediatly start recording messages. Just type ahead. ðŸ˜Ž
  When you need me to finish just use /finish.

  Hints:
  - Currently bots can't see when messages are deleted. The recording will still contain these messages.
  - Bots cant interact with each other (to prevent unwanted spam loops). Interactions with other bots will not be recorded.
group-peek =
  The recording is still running. This is only a snapshot. Use /finish when you wish to end the recording.
group-finish-greeting =
  Thanks for using, see you next time!
group-finish-empty =
  There are no messages in the recording.
