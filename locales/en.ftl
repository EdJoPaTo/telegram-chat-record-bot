private-start =
  Hey {$firstname}!
  For a private chat nothing is recorded or saved. Add me to a group. I will start to record all the messages I can see as soon as I joined the group.

  If you like this bot send a thank you to {$username} or head to the GitHub Repository.
  {$repolink}
channel-fail =
  Adding a random bot as an admin to your channel is maybe not the best ideaâ€¦

  Sincerely, a random bot, added as an admin to this channel.
group-joined =
  I'll immediatly start recording messages. Just type ahead. ðŸ˜Ž
  When you need me to finish just use /finish.

  Hints:
  - Currently bots can't see when messages are deleted. The recording will still contain these messages.
  - Bots can't interact with each other (to prevent unwanted spam loops). Interactions with other bots will not be recorded.
group-peek =
  The recording is still running. This is only a snapshot. Use /finish when you wish to end the recording.
group-finish-greeting =
  Thanks for using, see you next time!
group-finish-empty =
  There are no messages in the recording.
group-privacy =
  As long as this bot is within this group it records the activity in this group.

  Use /finish to end the recording. I will leave the group and delete all data about it after sending the recording.
  (Removing me from the group also deletes your data, but doesn't allow me to send the recording before leaving. You should use /finish instead.)

  For the source code of this bot see {$repolink}
