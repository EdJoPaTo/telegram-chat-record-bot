    Hey ${from.first_name}!

    Add me to a chat. I will start to record all the messages I can see as soon as I joined the group.


    If you like this bot send a thank you to ${username} or head to the GitHub Repository.

    Adding a random bot as an admin to your channel is maybe not the best ideaâ€¦


    Sincerely, a random bot, added as an admin to this channel.

    I'll immediatly start recording messages.
    Just type ahead. ðŸ˜Ž

    When you need me to finish just use /finish.


    Hints:

    - Currently bots can't see when messages are deleted.
    The recording will still contain these messages.

    - Bots cant interact with each other (to prevent unwanted spam loops).
    Interactions with other bots will not be recorded.
  peek: >
    The recording is still running.
    This is only a snapshot.
    Use /finish when you wish to end the recording.

      There are no messages in the recording.
